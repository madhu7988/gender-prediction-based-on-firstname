# Gender prediction based on firstname
<br>
This project is a gender prediction tool that predicts the gender (male or female) based on a given first name. It utilizes both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to make accurate predictions. The project includes dataset files, Jupyter notebooks for ML and DL model implementations, pickle files for model and data processing, and a Streamlit app script for a user-friendly interface.
